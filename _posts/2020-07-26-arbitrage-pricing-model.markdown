Arbitrage pricing model is based on Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) which captures the sensitivity of the asset's returns to changes in certain macroeconomic variables that affect it. Occasionaly, assets gets mispriced in the market – either overvalued or undervalued – for a brief period of time. However, market action should eventually correct the situation, moving price back to its fair market value. To an arbitrageur, temporarily mispriced securities represent a short-term opportunity to profit virtually risk-free. The APT aims to pinpoint the fair market price of a security that may be temporarily incorrectly priced. For example, the returns on Microsoft’s stock can be explained can be explained based on a set of macroeconomic and financial variables.

### Problem Statement

We wish to develop a model to predict the fair price of Microsoft's stock using Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) 

### Model development 

**1.Identify factors**
The first step is to identify factors that we believe affects the return on the asset. 
In our case, it has been identified that

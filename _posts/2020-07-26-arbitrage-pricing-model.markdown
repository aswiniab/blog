Arbitrage pricing model is based on Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) which captures the sensitivity of the asset's returns to changes in certain macroeconomic variables that affect it. Occasionaly, assets gets mispriced in the market – either overvalued or undervalued – for a brief period of time. However, market action should eventually correct the situation, moving price back to its fair market value. To an arbitrageur, temporarily mispriced securities represent a short-term opportunity to profit virtually risk-free. The APT aims to pinpoint the fair market price of a security that may be temporarily incorrectly priced. For example, the returns on Microsoft’s stock can be explained can be explained based on a set of macroeconomic and financial variables.

### Problem Statement

We wish to develop a model to predict the fair price of Microsoft's stock using Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) 

### Development of Model

**Step1.Identification of factors affecting the stock**
The first step is to identify factors that we believe affects the return on the asset. 
In the case presented here, the following factors have been identified to impact the return of Microsoft stock:
- S&P500 index
- Consumer price index
- Industrial production index
- Treasury bill yields
- Consumer credit
- Credit spread (difference in annualised average yield sbetween a paortfolio of bonds rated AAA and a portfolio of bonds rated BAA)

| Factor | Impact on Microsoft's stock return |
|:---:|:---:|
|S&P500 index|Positive|
|Consumer price index|Positive|
|Industrial production index|Positive|
|Treasury bill yields|Positive|
|Consumer credit|Positive|
|Credit spread|Positive|
